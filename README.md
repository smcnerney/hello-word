Also, you may ask Kendra what version they are currently installing on the systems they are shipping.  Just recently they changed the lead screw pitch and they probably released a new software.  I’m betting it’s the Ver 3.03.04.190, but it would be good to double check with her.  Another this is that the ligandBinding ver on this folder seems to be old.  You should probably ask her which ligandBinding ver software they are shipping.
